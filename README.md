# Bimodal colloids highlight the structural mirror of rigidity percolation and yielding
This is a simulation and analysis pipeline for identifying the mechanically relevant structures that produce elastic response and yielding behavior in colloidal depletion gels.

Simulations can be run using the [sim-scripts](./sim-scripts) and the DPDMorse extension for HOOMD-blue v4.2.1, available as [hoomd4.2.1-mod](https://github.com/procf/hoomd4.2.1-mod).

To confirm that a system is at equilibrium before gelation, use [analysis-eq](./analysis-scripts/analysis-eq)

Shear simulation script is available for the [bimodal system](./sim-scripts/bi/shear-const-0.5-allinit-bi-DPD) 

## What to expect
For systems of ~10,000 colloidal particles the following scripts are available:

- Construct a network representation of colloid-colloid bonds
- Identify tetrahedral structures
- Calculate edge-betweenness centrality (EBC) for all contacts and isolate edges with the top 10% of values
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based mesoscale clustering and classification of cluster-cluster contacts

- Quench the system to remove negative-curvature artifacts
- Calculate the relative contribution of different bonds to the affine (Born) contribution to the static shear modulus
- Calculate the relative localization of the non-affine response using a per-bond harmonic relaxation energy

- Classify bond breaks that occur during shear
- Calculate per-particle non-affine motion using $\langle D^2_{min} \rangle$
- Measure bond orientation from the fabric tensor
- Calculate cumulative mean strain per bond

Note: GMM clustering and FIRE quenching can each take ~9hrs. Other analyses typically take less than 1min. 

In bimodal depletion gels, colloid-colloid interactions scale with particle size. Therefore, the attraction strength for S-S, S-L, and L-L contacts will be different.
For size ratio 1:2 this scales roughly with the arithmetic mean, such that $D_0^{SL} = 1.5 D_0^{SS}$ and $D_0^{LL} = 2 D_0^{SS}$.

## Background

The fact that rigidity percolation and yielding can both be described as non-linear phase transitions makes it appealing to
believe that these processes are mirror images that form a single continuous transition. However, in amorphous materials, 
these transitions usually occur through complex multiscale interactions among a variety of structural features. We use large-scale 
simulations to compare 3 different structural classes commonly studied in colloidal gels: locally rigid tetrahedra, mesoscale 
cluster-cluster bridges, and connectivity-critical bonds with high values of edge-betweenness centrality (EBC). We find that bridges 
and high-EBC bonds appear to perform similar mechanical roles in both bulk elastic response and yielding behavior, which suggests that
the high-EBC subset describes the structural mirror that carries these transitions. We also find that the large particles 
present in a bimodal colloidal gel effectively label these features.

Here's the abstract: 

*In metastable particulate gels, it is tempting to believe that the dynamic similarities between
the fluid-to-solid non-linear phase transition of rigidity percolation and the solid-to-fluid transition
that occurs during yielding represent mirror images of the same continuous process. Even though
these behaviors are clearly dynamically similar, their multi-scale nature makes it difficult to deter-
mine if they could also follow a unified structural pathway. We know from model monodisperse
colloidal gels that both yielding and the elastic modulus seem to be heavily influenced by a small
subset of topologically distinct singly-connected bridges linking mesoscale features. Here we use
particle simulations to examine the participation of different classes of particle-level bonds and
their contributions to the bulk mechanical response. We find that rigidity is disproportionately
supported by singly connected intercluster bridges, whereas yielding localizes at bonds with high
edge-betweenness centrality (EBC); strikingly, these independently identified populations substan-
tially overlap and perform comparable mechanical roles. Bimodality exposes this correspondence by
concentrating large-particle contacts in both populations, thereby providing a compositional label
for the common backbone. Thus, rigidity and yielding are opposing mechanical manifestations of
the same mesoscale structure: the intercluster bottlenecks that establish rigidity are also the sites
at which rigidity is preferentially lost.*
